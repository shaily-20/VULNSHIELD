# VULNSHIELD
GUI of vulnerability scanner in java
VULNSHIELD is a Java Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI) designed to simulate a web vulnerability scanner comparison tool. The application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring different functionalities related to web security, but it is important to note that this application is only a GUI theme and does not perform actual vulnerability scanning.

Key Features:
User Authentication: The application starts with an authentication dialog, requiring a username and password to proceed. If the credentials are incorrect or the user cancels, the application exits.

Main Interface:

Dashboard Tab: Displays welcome information, including a clickable link to an example website, version details, supported operating systems, and other application capabilities. Progress bars illustrate metrics like market value, vulnerability set coverage, user adoption, and web server security.
Input Tab: Allows users to input the target IP or host, select scan types and levels, and specify export methods for the results. Clicking the "Scan" button simulates a scan and presents static results in a dialog.
Scanner Comparison Tab: Provides a comparative table of various web vulnerability scanners based on detection rate, accuracy, speed, and supported protocols.
Research & Q&A Tab: Contains a section for frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to web security and a panel highlighting recent research topics and opportunities for community contributions.
Menu Bar:

File Menu: Includes an exit option.
Settings Menu: Provides options for viewing an about dialog, selecting a theme (dark, light, or system default), and accessing account settings.
Help Menu: Contains a usage guide to assist users with the application.
History Menu: Allows users to view a history of simulated scans stored in a local text file.
Notifications: A button in the menu bar simulates notifications, providing sample messages.

Theme Selection: Users can change the theme of the application to dark, light, or system default through the settings menu.

This application is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only. It does not perform actual web vulnerability scanning or provide real-time security analysis. The functionalities are simulated to illustrate the potential features of a real web vulnerability scanner.
